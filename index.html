					<strong>It was the most watched episode in Startup Now history when Lucy Cooper, an Ivy League University Student, scored the biggest win in Startup Now history as all 5 judges teamed up to get 25% of the company! After taking over the emerging health industry in just 6 months, she is now ready to take over the world with the help of the judges. After a complete rebrand and repackaging, Lucy is now ready to launch Shape U worldwide.
				</strong></p>
				<p><span class="up">N</span>ever before had the judging panel unanimously decided to put their faith into a potential company.</p>
				<p>The Startup Now panel have personally mentored her, helping her undergo rebranding and re-packing of her miracle product.</p>
				<p>Touting her discovery as <i>“the greatest step forward in reshaping history,”</i> the judges were quick to offer their help to back the entrepreneurial young woman.</p>
				<p><i>“I was shocked. The most I was hoping for was some advice…I wasn't even sure that I would manage to convince any judges,”</i> explained Lucy.</p>
				<p>After outstanding offers from each panel member, the young woman burst into tears.</p>
				<p><i>“It didn’t feel real. The fact that all these successful, business-minded people wanted to be a part of what we were doing and were willing to help me as much as they could, it was very emotional!”</i> explained Lucy's partner.</p>
				<p>The young woman is the first contestant in the show’s long duration to ever receive a standing ovation and offers from all panel members. Lucy and her team said they celebrated the success with champagne and cake when the episode wrapped.</p>
				<p><span style="font-size:12px">The Ivy League student was the first contestant in Startup Now history to receive offers from all five panel members.</p>
				<p>Since filming the show-stopping episode, Lucy has been working hard to put the advice of her mentors into practice.</p>
				<p><i>“We completely re-branded our company and came up with new packaging,”</i> said Lucy's partner.</p>
				<p>This young woman's small team recently unveiled the product that made them famous.</p>
				<p><i>“The product we displayed on the show has been rebranded into the Shape U. It’s the original product, all we’ve done is change the name and the packaging,”</i> explained Lucy.</p>
				<p>These students launched the products through their company website and say they run out within 5 minutes.</p>
				<p><i>“We even made sure we had more product than we thought we could need, but all of it was gone within five minutes!”,</i> she explained.</p>
				<p>While the Startup Now judges are toasting to their smart business move, women around the world are flocking online to get Shape U and say the results are amazing.</p>
				<p>Women who used the Shape U were able to look and feel better in no time.</p>
